                        the LP was an immediate critical and commertial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the

                        and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in peychedelic and hard rock

                        The budget for the recordings was rather limited so Chas Chandler (producer) and Hendrix
                        completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment.

                        Axis: Bold As Love's scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of
                        side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming,
                        Hendrix, Chas Chandier, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight
                        session.

                        Hendrix stated that the cover would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his Native
                        American heritage.

                        "Little Wing" is one of Hendrix's most popular songs, with interpretations recorded by musicians in
                        a variety of styles.
